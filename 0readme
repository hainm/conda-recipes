1. run 'conda config --add channels https://conda.binstar.org/ambermd' before build.

2. currently, I don't have a good solution to build lapack and blas in amber with conda.
So just copy lapackamber to $AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/lapack/, then go to that folder,
`conda build lapackamber` to use config.h file
